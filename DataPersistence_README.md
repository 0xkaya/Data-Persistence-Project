# Data Persistence in a New Repo

## Overview
This project demonstrates data persistence techniques in Unity, including saving and loading data between scenes and across sessions. The focus is on implementing methods to keep important game data intact even after the game is closed and reopened.

## Features
- **Project Backup**: Implements a system to back up important project data, ensuring that it can be restored when needed.
- **Data Persistence Between Scenes**: Saves and retrieves data when transitioning between different scenes, ensuring continuity in gameplay.
- **Data Persistence Between Sessions**: Stores data persistently across game sessions, allowing the playerâ€™s progress to be saved and restored when the game is relaunched.
